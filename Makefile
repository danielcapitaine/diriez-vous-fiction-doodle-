# XXX.bewest: Mocha is an odd process, and since things are being
# wrapped and transformed, this odd path needs to be used, not the
# normal wrapper.  When ./node_modules/.bin/mocha is used, no coverage
# information is generated.  This happens because typical shell
# wrapper performs process management that mucks with the test
# coverage reporter's ability to instrument the tests correctly.
# Hard coding it to the local with our pinned version is bigger for
# initial installs, but ensures a consistent environment everywhere.
# On Travis, ./node_modules/.bin and other `nvm` and `npm` bundles are
# inserted into the default `$PATH` enviroinment, making pointing to
# the unwrapped mocha executable necessary.
